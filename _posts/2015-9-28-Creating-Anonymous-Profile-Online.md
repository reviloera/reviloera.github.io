>**Disclaimer** I accept no responsibility for any outcome of following this advice

The flip side of the digital age is the massive automated surveillance by the government. Most of us get in trouble as the *big brother* eats much of our freedom. I intend to share a few ideas that can make someone be off the radar. To achieve this goal we must identify the key areas that act as loopholes into our privacy.

1. Email accounts
2. Our connection to the internet
3. The information we share online

### Avoid mainstream email accounts like gmail , yahoo e.t.c

We all know that to have a social media account an email address is mandatory. A mainstream email is a big sell out. What you need to have is an **encrypted email account** , one that doest share your information with anyone and doest have robots reading your emails. I would recommend [PROTONMAIL](https://protonmail.ch/). Its supper encrypted plus the servers are in Switzerland so no gevernment can tamper with them. 
With anonymous email that doest link to you , you have a headstart.

### Use a public internet connection

Assume you are an activist , you need to cover your tracks. Publishing information online from your place of work or using your home internet is a big gamble, your Ip address will always link back to you. To be safe use cyber cafe or public internet. Rember if you form a predictable pattern online you might be in trouble.

In addition to that, there are some softare tools that can make you more anonymous. A good software that I would recommend is [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/). Now this guardian angel will create a little heaven for you online .All your internet request will be anonymous and encrypted.

One thing that you also need to note. As you browse the internet, there are many tracking softwares that track your movement as you work online. You can get rid of these by installing browser plugins like **Ghostery , Adblocker** this will ensure no robot profiles you online.

### The infomation we share online:

Be careful on what you post. Don't make comments that can link back to you and remember if you share photos online every photo has some **Exif Data** attached to it. This data can tell when the photo was taken, the location and other details jeopardizing your concealed identity. Some of this data you can scrap off using these tools

### Conclusion 

As always stay safe big brother is watching !
