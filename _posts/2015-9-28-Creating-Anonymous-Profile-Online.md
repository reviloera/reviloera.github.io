The flip side of the digital age is the massive automated survaillance by the government. Most of us get in trouble as the *big brother* eats much of our freedom. I intend to share a few ideas that can make someone be off the radar. To achieve this goal we must identify the key areas that act as loopholes into our privacy.

1. Email accounts
2. Our connection to the internet
3. The information we share online

### Avoid mainstream email accounts like gmail , yahoo e.t.c

We all know that to have a social media account an email address is mandatory. A mainstream email is a big sell out. What you need to have is an **encrypted email account** , one that doest share your information with anyone and doest have robots reading your emails. I would recommend [PROTONMAIL](https://protonmail.ch/). Its supper encrypted plus the servers are in Switzerland so no gevernment can tamper with them.
